# Hybird_images
We will write an image convolution function (image filtering) and use it to create hybrid images ! The
technique was invented by Oliva, Torralba, and Schyns in 2006, and published in a paper at
SIGGRAPH . High frequency image content tends to dominate perception but, at a distance, only low
frequency (smooth) content is perceived. By blending high and low frequency content, we can create a
hybrid image that is perceived differently at different distances.

For the full requirements:  Check "01_CIE552_Proj_HybridImage" 
For the full code documentation and explanation:  Check Project Report

To run the project and get the results:
1. Run helpers.py
2. Run proj1_part1.py
3. Run proj1_part2.py

Download the data from "data.zip"
Download the results (different hybird images) from "All results.zip"
